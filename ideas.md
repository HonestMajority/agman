- Stored commands?
  - I.e. commands which can simply be selected, without any input from the tui
  - e.g. "Create draft PR" - creates a PR on github, with a good description, monitors that all tests pass, fixes in new commit if not.
  - e.g. "Address review" - look at all existing review comments, determine which should be addressed, fix each point in a separate commit, and then push all. End with printing a summary of comments which I can print as a response to each comment, including the commit hash of the commit which addresses
